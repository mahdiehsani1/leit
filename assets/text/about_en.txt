About Leit
Version 1.0.0

Leit is your intelligent, privacy-first companion for mastering the German language. Created with care and precision by Mahdi Ehsani, the app helps you build and retain vocabulary through proven scientific methods.

Key Features & How It Works

1. The Leitner System (Spaced Repetition Done Right)
At the heart of Leit is the classic Leitner box method enhanced with spaced repetition. Instead of reviewing words randomly, the app schedules your practice sessions based on performance. Each card moves through 6 levels—correct answers move it forward, mistakes send it back—ensuring true long-term learning.

2. Advanced Vocabulary Management
Each entry can hold everything you need for complete understanding: the German word, English and Persian translations, article (der/die/das), plural form, verb conjugations, example sentences, synonyms, and your personal grammar notes.

3. Full Offline Privacy & Manual Backup
Your learning data stays on your device—fully offline.

Backup: Export your entire database as a file and store it wherever you trust.

Restore: Switching devices? Import your backup and instantly recover all your progress.

4. Optional Account & Minimal Analytics
You can use Leit completely anonymously. Signing in with Google is optional and only helps us measure active users and collect essential crash reports for stability improvements. Vocabulary data is never synced to the cloud; it remains entirely on your device.

5. Visual Progress Insights
Stay motivated with a clear Statistics dashboard that shows your daily activity, answer accuracy, and how your learning cards are distributed across all levels.

A focused and thoughtfully designed experience to help you learn German efficiently and confidently.
