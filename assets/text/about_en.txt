About Leit

Leit is your intelligent, privacy-first companion for mastering the German language.
Created with care and precision by Mahdi Ehsani, the app helps you build and retain vocabulary through proven scientific methods.

Key Features & How It Works

1. The Leitner System (Spaced Repetition Done Right)
At the heart of Leit is the classic Leitner box method enhanced with smart spaced repetition.
Instead of reviewing words randomly, the app schedules your practice sessions based on your performance.
Each card moves through 6 levels—correct answers move it forward, mistakes send it back—ensuring true long-term learning.

2. Comprehensive Vocabulary & Audio
Each entry holds everything you need for mastery: German word, English and Persian translations, articles (der/die/das), plural forms, verb conjugations, and synonyms.
Plus, utilize the integrated Text-to-Speech feature to practice pronunciation for every item.

3. Secure Cloud Backup & Sync
Never lose your progress.
Sign in securely with your Google account to enable Cloud Backup.
Your database is encrypted and stored in your private directory on Google Firebase, allowing you to restore your progress on any device.

4. Privacy, Transparency & Control
We value your data privacy:
- Offline First: The app works perfectly without internet.
- Local Notifications: Daily reminders are scheduled directly on your device for maximum privacy.
- Open Source Transparency: You can view the open-source libraries we use in Settings.
- Full Ownership: You can clear your local data or permanently delete your account and cloud backups instantly from the 'Account Zone'.

5. Visual Progress Insights
Stay motivated with a clear Statistics dashboard showing your daily activity, accuracy trends, and card distribution across all learning boxes.

A focused experience designed to help you learn German efficiently and confidently.
